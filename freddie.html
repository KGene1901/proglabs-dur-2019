    <h1>Artificial Intelligence in Agriculture</h1>
    <p class="lead">By Freddie Miller</p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0"><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> is neither good nor evil. It's a tool. It's a technology for us to use.</p>
      <footer class="blockquote-footer">Oren Etzioni</footer>
    </blockquote>

    <p>There's no doubt that <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> has a bad reputation. Most coverage from the media shows <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> stealing our jobs, and vastly outperforming humans driving us to extinction. Some of these claims may be true, however the currently <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> does much social good and is extremely useful.</p>
    <p>Although <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> and Agriculture couldn't seem further apart, the two fields work together very well in a time where crop shortages are a real threat to the world.</p>
    <p>Agriculture and farming is one of the oldest and most important professions in the world. Humanity has come a long way over the millennia in how we farm and grow crops with the introduction of various technologies. As the world population continues to grow and land becomes more scarce, people have needed to get creative and become more efficient about how we farm, using less land to produce more crops and increasing the productivity and yield of those farmed acres. Worldwide, agriculture is a $5 trillion industry, and now the industry is turning to AI technologies to help yield healthier crops, control pests, monitor soil and growing conditions, organize data for farmers, help with workload, and improve a wide range of agriculture-related tasks in the entire food supply chain.</p>

    <h2>AI helping to analyze farm data</h2>
    <p>Farms produce hundreds of thousands of data points on the ground daily. With the help of AI, farmers can now analyze a variety of things in real time such as weather conditions, temperature, water usage or soil conditions collected from their farm to better inform their decisions. For example, AI technologies help farmers optimize planning to generate more bountiful yields by determining crop choices, the best hybrid seed choices and resource utilization.
      <br><br>
      AI systems are also helping to improve harvest quality and accuracy -- what is known as precision agriculture. Precision agriculture uses AI technology to aid in detecting diseases in plants, pests, and poor plant nutrition on farms.  AI sensors can detect and target weeds and then decide which herbicides to apply within the right buffer zone. This helps to prevent over application of herbicides and excessive toxins that find their way in our food.
      <br><br>
      Farmers are also using AI to create seasonal forecasting models to improve agricultural accuracy and increase productivity. These models are able to predict upcoming weather patterns months ahead to assist decisions of farmers. Seasonal forecasting is particularly valuable for small farms in developing countries as their data and knowledge can be limited. Keeping these small farms operational and growing bountiful yields is important as these small farms produce 70% of the worldâ€™s crops.
      <br><br>
      
      In addition to ground data, farmers are also taking to the sky to monitor the farm. Computer vision and deep learning algorithms process data captured from drones flying over their fields. From drones, AI enabled cameras can capture images of the entire farm and analyze the images in near-real time to identify problem areas and potential improvements. Unmanned drones are able to cover far more land in much less time than humans on foot allowing for large farms to be monitored more frequently.</p>
